Windows 7 upgrade installed  , and I was instantly amazed at how fast and sleek everything looked .\\n121

fast and intuitive .\\n122                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I started to upload a youtube video, went away to have breakfast and came back to a blue screen of death .\",\n          \"

are currently on right above your current displayed speed .\\n0                                                                                                                                                                   I found myself not even looking at my car speedometer as I could easily see my current speed and the speed limit of my route at a glance .\\n1                                                                                                                                        My final decision was to keep the 255w and return the 750 because I really liked the graphic turn indicator and the posted speed limit and current speed indicators .\\n2

                                                                                                     The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .\\n4                                                                                                          Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .\\n5

                                                    With a reset button, you can track your max speed, moving time, stopped time, average speed total for the trip, average moving speed, etc .\\n7                                                                                                                                                                                       It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .\\n8                                                                                                                                  Well, you can one up him now by not only announcing the time, but the average speed as well, and you have documented proof of the reason you were delayed for precisely 7

                                      The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n11                                                                                                                                                                                                            TomTom seems to underestimate speed limits on community highways and gives sub, optimal routes .\\n12                                                 For example, on the route from Rocky Mountain National park to Arches National Park Garmin's route is 40 mins shorter on a 7 hour drive because it chooses shorter route along minor highways instead of longer route along I, 70 with higher speed limit .\\n13                                                                                                     If you are driving in NYC or other major city, be prepared to add 1 minute for each red traffic light and beware that Garmin expects you to drive with a speed close to speed limit along NYC streets .\\n14

highways and some streets .\\n15   That newer interface, as another reviewer has mentioned, gives you speed limits on some major roads, shows you your current speed, puts the zoom buttons closer together, changes text size to give you road names, and shows you the direction of the next upcoming turn near the distance to the turn .\\n16                                                                                                                                                                                        SPEED, , on most major highways, it tells what the speed limit is for that road   AND tells you what your speed is .\\n17

                                                                                                                                                    On the lower left hand side, this unit shows the maximum speed limit for the road you are traveling .\\n19                                                                                                                                                                                            This is very useful feature because many a times this will help to avoid the risk of getting a speeding ticket .\\n20                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         By the way, the bottom menu also shows your current driving speed .\\n21

                                                                                                                                                         And, it's nice that the Garmin tells you that, at your current speed, you'll reach your destination in 43 minutes .\\n23                                                                                                                                                                                  When you are looking at the map, you are shown the speed limit for the road you are travelling on, and your actual speed .\\n24                                                                                                                     I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n25                                                                                                                                 I can see that this could at some point become out of date if the governing authority changes the speed limit on a particular road, but it is a cool function nonetheless .\\n26                                                                                                                                                                                                          It was fun to know where you are and the speed that you are going and the time you will be there .\\n27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        6 Love the speed limit and actual speed indicators .\\n28                                                                                                                                                 I have observed several cases on an interstate where the 255W required driving well over the speed limit in order to achieve the initial arrival estimate .\\n29                                                                                                                                                         The city routes were somewhat closer but they could not have actually been faster because of the numerous traffic lights and slower driving speed .\\n30                                                                                                                                                                                     I really love the new interface, the turn signs at the corner, speed limit indicator and the fast satellite reception .\\n31                                                                                                                                                It has a lot of good features ,  including a speedometer, posted speed limits on major roads, and it notes your average and max speed on your

                                                 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .\\n37

it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n38                    I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n39

of, the speed limit is 45, the GPS says that the speed limit is 50 .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                         From what I have seen as far as the speed limit issue is that it is off only by 5mph, but dead on in other places .\\n41

week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n42                                                                                                                      The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n43                                                                                 I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n44

                                    The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .\\n46

traffic and content updates   .\\n3   The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .\\n4

                                                             I first bought it from another site that was cheaper by $25 and they told me that I needed to buy a memory card to download map updates

next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .\\n8                                                                              Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends .\\n9

time .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                   Map update ,  when you register it on, line   you get an offer for one free map update .\\n46                                                                                                                                                  I plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update, then probably never purchase an update .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                              By the time it needs a new update the unit will be obsolete .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                          MapSource also makes it easy to update your unit's map annually .\\n49                                                                I have no need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n50                                                                                                                  The only nitpick disappointment was when I downloaded the free 2010 map update it dosn't show road extensions completed a few years ago .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                           Getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                              easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map .\\n53                                                                                                                       ,  Also very quick and I mean quick reroute when you miss a turn plus smooth update position when moving, not choppy on the screen .\\n54                                                                                                                ,  Updating the GPS took way to long and I have DSL ,  4 hours to download a 2GB map update and 3 hours to install the program to the GPS .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                              I read that some Mac user could not get it to update at all .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,  No traffic update but don't really need it\\n57                                                                                                                                           We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .\\n58                                                                                                                                 The sound isn't that bad, Just make sure you get your free map update from the Garmin site within the 60 day time period .\\n59                                                                                                                                                    Not so ,  tried the Garmin web site for an updated map and was told by Garmin that none was available .\\n60                                                                                                                                                                                               Loading a map update is another experience I won't go into .\\n61

                                                                                                                                                                            Glad I updated the map and

update , Drove it locally in San Diego and it worked fabulously .\\n64                                                                                                                          in a

Rocky Mountain National park to Arches National Park Garmin's route is 40 mins shorter on a 7 hour drive because it chooses shorter route along minor highways instead of longer route along I, 70 with higher speed limit .\\n13                                                                                                     If you are driving in NYC or other major city, be prepared to add 1 minute for each red traffic light and beware that Garmin expects you to drive with a speed close to speed limit along NYC streets .\\n14

road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .\\n25                                                                                                                                 I can see that this could at some point become out of date if the governing authority changes the speed limit on a particular road, but it is a cool function nonetheless .\\n26

required driving well over the speed limit in order to achieve the initial arrival estimate .\\n29                                                                                                                                                         The city routes were somewhat closer but they could not have actually been faster because of the numerous traffic lights and slower driving speed

downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n39

The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n43

signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n44

shows the road's speed limit right above your actual speed, which I find most helpful, since, again, I use it mostly in areas where I'm not familiar with the roads and local speed limits .\\n66

                                            I found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .\\n30

             I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n34                                                                                                                                                          It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .\\n35                                                                                                                                                            I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n36

                                                  All I can really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .\\n38                                                                                                         I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .\\n39

                                                                                                    One guy posted on the forum that he had an older device and paid to update to the 2009 map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .\\n42

                                    I discovered that I need it while trying to register the device and or to get updated maps at the Garmin website .\\n44

               I plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update, then probably never purchase an update .\\n47

me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .\\n50                                                                                                                  The only nitpick disappointment was when I downloaded the free 2010 map update it dosn't show road extensions completed a few years ago .\\n51

                             ,  Updating the GPS took way to long and I have DSL ,  4 hours to download a 2GB map update and 3 hours to install the program to the GPS .\\n55

put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again\\n133

service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times .\\n481

to do what one needs to .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .\\n47

so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49

outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n53

shower .\\n54

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

                                     It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .\\n67                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .\\n68                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                             The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was clean but a little dated .\\n73                                                                                                                                                                                                        The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

 .\\n77

mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .\\n80

     but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .\\n10

areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .\\n11

of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .\\n13

                               Traffic directions are as good and detailed as can be, as you would expect from a Garmin, and less intrusive than on some other brands .\\n18

                    The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .\\n38                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The spoken turn, by, turn directions are clear and very timely .\\n41   My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        You can even get turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .\\n43                                                                                                                                         Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            button, and it gave us directions right to Carmel .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .\\n46                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                 It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                                     I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                        I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .\\n53                                                                                                                                                                                                        Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                                                     I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .\\n56

mapping Web site and recite the directions .\\n57                                                                                                                   Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .\\n58

                                                                                                                                                                                                        There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .\\n60

bought the first one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .\\n61

were following me for directions .\\n62

                                                                                                                             The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .\\n64

which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .\\n65

took a roadtrip with no  squabbling  about directions .\\n66

spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .\\n74

                                   I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .\\n77

                                               But driving on the highway with music on and windows down, it will be hard to hear the directions using just 70% of volume .\\n95

                                                 It doesn't take long to locate satellites, maybe 15 seconds or so .\\n34

               It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .\\n40

it found the satellites very quickly .\\n42

there may be features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .\\n46

                                                   As for the video camera it's a nice addition considering it's an mp3 player first and foremost, I think people are going to go into this and think

seems to be a necessary evil in order to tag say a video as music and not a movie, so though i originally started with 3rd party apps for syncing i have since switched to itunes .\\n25

its iPod formula in a small, but not insignificant way by gracing the back of the Nano with its own video camera .\\n26

D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .\\n28

                                    I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .\\n30

I don't have a TV Tuner, so I can't take advantage of that feature, but there are other features & it seems to be working good .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       00 dollars just to upgrade for some fancy new features .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Since my Google Sidebar had some features that I liked, it allowed me to replace it for the Windows one .\\n42                                                                                                                                                                                               Because others on this site have already described in sufficient detail all the amazing features of W7, I will not repeat them .\\n43

difficult to list all here .\\n44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         All   of these features have worked 100% of the time, which is previously unheard of .\\n45                                                                                                                              Removing a  feature  from the Programs and Features panel simply disables access to it, but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .\\n46                                                                                                                                                          I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   All the features of Vista, but without any of the problems .\\n48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            It still works pretty good though, just a lack of some features that i had before .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                            What I will highlight are a few features of Windows 7 which I have been thoroughly impressed with .\\n50                                                                                                                      Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .\\n52                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Does the new operating system have cool features ?\\n53                                                                                                                              My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .\\n54                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .\\n55                                                                                                                                                                I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Smooth OS with great little features .\\n57                                                                                                                                                                                         A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .\\n58                                                                                                    If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .\\n59

already .\\n60

room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .\\n38

seemed poor quality .\\n40                                                                                                                                                                                      Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n41

                                                                                                                                                                                                      There are no bottle openers or cork screws in the room so ask room service for them if you need them .\\n43

unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it .\\n44

good throughout my stay .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .\\n46

enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .\\n71

be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .\\n73                                   The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit

selection as it did .\\n74

was previously installed in the room with no problem  this time round, I was told there was a flat US$50 fee for this, irrespective of the duration of the stay .\\n20

make things very busy if you are staying during one of these events  service can be slow and erratic, and the wait for elevators can be long and frustrating !\\n21

            the variable cylinder management changes to 4 cyl when not under load, this helps with fuel mileage .\\n33

        Aside from missing the turbo's acceleration, I've preferred the Accord's better mileage, handling and comfort .\\n38

                                                         While the mileage is not bad it good be better, but as the acceleration is good for a 4 cylinder it's a trade, off .\\n63

                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71                                                                                                                                                                                                 Gas mileage is still getting better though .\\n72                                                                                                                                                                           The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76                                                                                                                                                                           Posted mileage ratings are for those who have a heavy right foot .\\n77                                                                                                                                                            Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80                                                                                                                                                                                                            190 hp and superior gas mileage .\\n81                                                                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or 900 RPM and about 38 going 70 .\\n83                                                                                                                                                  The Gas mileage is good, the acceleration sometime is slow when cold from 1st to 2nd gear .\\n84                                                                                                                                                                                     I hope to get better mileage on extended highway trips .\\n85                                                                                                          I think the mileage would be even better with a 6, speed stick shift to drop the tachometer from ~2300 rpm to <2000 rpm at 60 mph .\\n86                                                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage has been improving and is now consistently 29 hwy 22 city .\\n87                                                                                                                                                                                       Very peppy engine great fuel mileage 28, 30 combined .\\n88                                                                                                                                                                            I am not known to drive slowly so I am pleased with the mileage .\\n89                                                                                                         We bought this car with the expectations of getting a car that feels good with my bad back, gets good gas mileage, and is reliable .\\n90                                                                                                                       So far, the reliability has been as expected, it is comfortable on my back, and the gas mileage has been pretty good .\\n91                                                                                                                                                         It is great to drive, has many nice features and gets you there with great mileage .\\n92                                                                                                                                                                           Mileage is very good and we have already taken it on a long trip .\\n93                                                                                                                                                                                         I had rather not have it and sacrifice the mileage .\\n94                                                                                                                                               The gas mileage has been as advertised, hitting 32 mpg on the highway when driving at 65 MPH .\\n95

is 22 mpg which is mostly highway and the car sometimes hesitates during acceleration\\n99

             with gas prices, wanted better mileage .\\n103                                                                                                                                                                               It gets good mileage on HWY = 30 but mediocre on local = 21 .\\n104

avg 20 mpg so far .\\n107  i just purchased my lx, p a couple of weeks ago, having driven a pick up for the last 25 years, i was really surprised at how much i like this car, going from a big v, 8 to a 4 is a change but the power is good, gas mileage is great .\\n108                                                                                                                                    At first the gas mileage was a disappointment, but as the car is now breaking in   it's getting better .\\n109                                                                                                                 I test the car and was very impressed with the looks and the 4cyl was adequate since gas mileage was very important to me .\\n110

this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .\\n30                 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .\\n31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !\\n32

comfy leather seats .\\n33   The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .\\n34                                                                                                                However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .\\n35                                                                                                                                                  At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .\\n36

                                        The styling does not say  Camry  anymore and the interior is mostly excellent ,  door handles are too hard and plasticky, some rattles especially when cold

                                               The interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 Camry LE .\\n32

               I love the look, and the comfort, but would never buy one again .\\n36    I've read other reviews stating that the leather seats were not comfortable for long drives due to lack of cushion support, but that's not been the case for me especially after recently driving from Houston to Key West, Fla .\\n37

more than satisfied with the performance, looks, and comfort .\\n41                                                                                                                                       A little stiffer ride than the xl and xle models I have had, but still comfortable and quiet .\\n42

                                                             The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .\\n45                                                                                       Over the month it was in the shop, we rented several different cars and nothing seemed to measure up to the comfort

.\\n80                                                                                                                                          It is a very comfortable car that gives us options that we never had on previous vehicles .\\n81                                               I test drove and compared similar 4 door sedans like the Maxima, Accord, Mazda6, and noticed that none had all the features,performance,comfort ,safety,and looks that the Camry has .\\n82

                                                                                                   The seats were very comfortable on a four and a half hour   trip, and wind and road noise were minimal .\\n86                                                                                                                                 The interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 Camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .\\n87

       Comfort is great, mileage is good overall, better on the road than expected  , compared to my 1999 Camry .\\n89                                                                                   Having flown 26 different aircraft and driven cars for 61 years, I find the 2007 Camry to be the most uncomfortable cockpit I have every been in .\\n90                                                                                                The headrest presses into my head at an uncomfortable angle and it is imposssible to tell where the front of the car is for parking .\\n91                                                                                                                                                              The window sill is too high and the armrest too low to be comfortable .\\n92                                                                                                        The new looks are what attracted it to me initially, but its relatively smooth drive, comfort and reliability sold me on it .\\n93                                                                                                                    It is a beautiful sapphire blue, has really nice lines, is very comfortable, is plenty peppy, and hugs the road .\\n94                             The ride is very comfortable, although I'm 6'6  and I didn't think head room was an issue but I do think leg room could be better, I think this is mainly because the back seats have tons of leg room .\\n95

                                                               Overall this car is very quiet, comfortable, smooth, powerful, and absolutly the best mid, size in the current market .\\n97

and now the ride is even quieter and comfortable .\\n99                                                                                                                                                                                                     Leather seats were comfortable .\\n100

                                                 My conclusion after doing a ton of research regarding safety, reliability, comfort and gas mileage :\\n102

                                                                           Bottom line was that I was going to be in that driver's seat for years to come and I was not going to skimp on the critical comfort factor .\\n104                                                                                                                                                While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .\\n105                           The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .\\n106                                                                                                                                                   , a luxurious comfort feature, and a fuel consumption that is best in the class .\\n107

                                                                                                                                                       Top notch rating on interior comfort .\\n109

                                                                                                                                     So beware, if you are trading in your V8 for a mileage vehicle, this is not it in my case .\\n40                                                                                                                                                     The car is getting great gas mileage   even though I have only been driving it 2 weeks .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                           Our 2008 Accord is very disappointing, our in town mileage is 14 .\\n42

                                                                                                                                          I just love the VCM makes the car give great mileage .\\n44

Initial gas mileage looks good too .\\n45                                                                                                                                                                                            Don't buy this car if you want good gas mileage .\\n46                                                                                                  I have a V, 6 with Variable Cylinder Management which is supposed to let the car run on 3,4 or 6 cylinders, as needed, to improve mileage .\\n47

                                                                It is fun to drive, I love the color, it has great features, the sound system is nice, the power is perfect and the gas mileage is great

OK  , but not as good as Honda advertises .\\n50                                                                                                                                                                     Gas mileage is wonderful, 1st tank 26 mpg with almost all city driving .\\n51                                                                                                                             I had tons of room in my 4Runner, but I needed something that would get better gas mileage w o giving up power .\\n52

I got .\\n54                                                                                                                                          I will warn you though, that if you drive it like it should be driven, gas mileage isn't the best .\\n55                                                                                                                                                     It feels safe, performs well, looks fantastic and gets decent gas mileage for its size .\\n56                                                                                                                                                                   The Accord is better than other those car on gas mileage and reliability .\\n57

                                                                                                                                                                  Some reviewers were complaining about

is horrible too, 20 mpg city highway after 6000 miles .\\n60                                                                                                                                       If you are looking for a car that is affordable and well built this is the car for you bad gas mileage\\n61                                                                                                                                        In reality we have been very disappointed our in city mileage is 16, 17 and highway is better at 27 .\\n62

                                                                                                                       I am sure as gas prices go up cars will be built to get better mileage at the expense of acceleration .\\n64                                                                                                                                     Good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .\\n65                                                                                                                                       I live in Chicago and drive downtown and back 2 times a week for school and am getting great mileage .\\n66                                                                                                                                                        Only update is after about 5k miles the fuel mileage is less than I had anticipated .\\n67                                                                                                               Everything else such gas mileage, handling, stereo system is fine but it doesn't make up for the loud rattles and wind noise .\\n68                                                                                                                         It's almost embarrassing driving such a nice car around a parking lot and have it sound like a high mileage beater .\\n69                                                                                                                             So I saved $2 K upfront and will also save down the road since the 4 cylinder gets slightly better gas mileage .\\n70                                                                                                                                                                         It is a well built car that runs smooth and gets great gas mileage .\\n71

                                                                                                                                             The gas mileage on the highway is about the same for both models .\\n73                                                                                                                                        Local mileage with the '08 has been about 24 mpg, and about 25 mpg with the '06's that we've leased .\\n74                                                                                                                                                              I decided to go back to Honda as even with high mileage they keep their value .\\n75                                                                                                                          Mileage ,  also not impressive ,  all I can get is about 24mpg, far from the 32 mpg you see on the window sticker .\\n76

                                                                                                                                      Gas mileage is fantastic especially going from a V8 SUV to a 4 cylinder sedan   .\\n78            I was tempted to go for the V6, but I drive 42 miles one way to work and we have an '07 Odyssey with the variable cylinder management system and unless you're on long highway runs it doesn't get the gas mileage Honda claims .\\n79                                                                       I just love this car ,  and with almost double the highway gas mileage that I was getting with my Grand Cherokee ,  that adds a lot of $$ towards my monthly payment .\\n80

                                                                                                                 It wasn't worth saving the little difference in gas mileage for this Honda .\\n82                                                                                                                   The gas mileage is about 45 to the gallon going on the highway with cruise at about 800 or

                                                                                                               my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .\\n48                                                                                                                     The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .\\n49                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .\\n50   Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .\\n51                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .\\n52

Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .\\n53

shower .\\n54

                Bathrooms were also very nice .\\n57

              Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .\\n59

the amenities we were looking for .\\n61

                                            Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .\\n64                                                                                                                                                          Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the

                                     It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .\\n66

hitting you no joke !\\n69                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .\\n70

were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .\\n71

could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .\\n72

                  The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .\\n74

                                                The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .\\n75

from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .\\n76

                                                                                                                                                                                                                      There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .\\n21

the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .\\n22                                                                                                                                                       Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a \\u00a36 .\\n23

           You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .\\n24

decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .\\n27

   There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .\\n29

as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !\\n30

                                Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so

recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .\\n43

                                                   The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .\\n45                                                                 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops

day the food served wasnt changed .\\n47                                                                                                                                                                                        We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .\\n48    The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .\\n49

                                             Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .\\n68

scotch were very reasonably priced always !\\n69

                                                                                                                                                                                   Another good thing is

fraction of the cost .\\n72

fast food if you like .\\n86                                                                                                                                                              Its location is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road underground station   .\\n87

overall standards .\\n88

the location .\\n89                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Location is great, 5 mins walk to the Natural History Museum, 15 to Kensington High St and 2 mins to the tube and in a high room you can see for miles   .\\n90

discovered that it does have some errors in its internal map .\\n26

            I found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .\\n29

                           Because the accuracy is good to the street address level, it may not be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .\\n32

latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .\\n33

it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n35

not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n38                                                                I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n39

                   After 2 weeks, it has yet to make a mistake, and is always completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .\\n41

                                   What the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy

the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !\\n38                    I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .\\n39                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The road I live off of, the speed limit is 45, the GPS says that the speed limit is 50 .\\n40

but dead on in other places .\\n41                                                                                                                                                                ,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .\\n42                                                                                                                      The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .\\n43                                                                                 I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .\\n44

it shows my speed and the posted speed limit .\\n45

for this one feature I leave the unit on even if it is not navigating to a set location .\\n55

back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .\\n27

doesn't go back far enough .\\n32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The touchpad works well, the screen glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .\\n33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        On full screen display is smooth and no issues .\\n34                                                                                                                                                                                                       Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .\\n35                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              And with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .\\n36              It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .\\n37

                              On a full charge, with wireless on, screen brightness on medium, I get a reported 8 .\\n38

                            I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .\\n46

                                     One of the other complaints I'd come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .\\n47

                                            yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .\\n48                                                            And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .\\n49

I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .\\n50

needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .\\n51

although it normally recovered from that .\\n52

screen fine .\\n54

                                                               Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .\\n56

            like others have said, it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .\\n57

excellent, with normal usage I can get about 7 hours easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .\\n89   One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .\\n90

                 Screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .\\n91

with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .\\n92

    The screen size works just fine for me .\\n93

never needing to use it   .\\n94                                                                                                                                                                                                               And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .\\n95

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The mouse pad is very sensitive so I sometimes find myself on a different part of the screen if I accidentally touch something .\\n130

                                                The screen is comfortable and sufficently bright for occassional use .\\n131

                                         The screen is crisp and clear, and the unit runs great .\\n132

                   The greatest shortcoming is the small screen resolution .\\n133

this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .\\n134                                                                                                                                                                                      I have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .\\n135

10 inch screen .\\n136

.\\n137

                                                                                                                                                                                                           Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .\\n139                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600 .\\n140

      The 10, inch screen is bright and has good color, and the keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .\\n141

good, screen very good, wireless very good, numerous USB ports, and keyboard layout is excellent .\\n142                                                                                                                                             It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .\\n143                                                                                                                                               But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .\\n144

is cracked with big black blotches as well .\\n145

                         Instead I convert DVDs to DVIX AVI files using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .\\n148

it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .\\n155                                                                                                                                                   As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .\\n156

screen looks good .\\n157

                                               For this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .\\n160

netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .\\n162

of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .\\n163

                                 The small screen is probably the biggest drawback .\\n164

aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .\\n165

using full screen mode on browser with F11 .\\n166

needed on this small screen .\\n167

go back .\\n168                                                                                                                                                                                           Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .\\n169                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            One hint ,  there's a setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .\\n170                                                                                                                                                                                                           I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .\\n171                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         As others have noted, I wish the screen wasn't so reflective .\\n172                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     And maybe it's something I need to figure out how to fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .\\n173

                         Has all the features of my bigger laptop except a large screen .\\n174

                                1 inch screen is bigger than the 8 .\\n175
